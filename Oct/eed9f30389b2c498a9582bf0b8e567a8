By: Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- Another Democratic Alliace (DA) councillor has dumped the party to join Gayton McKenzie’s Patriotic Alliance (PA). Councillor Daniel Netnow of Ward 7 in Ennerdale joined the PA this week. He said he was disappointed by the DA which he said was not truly committed to upliftment of coloured communities. “I see the PA as the only political party that is serious about the plight of coloured communities and all the people of South Africa,” Netnow told Africa News 24-7. Netnow is the second DA councillor in a matter of days who left the DA to join the PA. Africa News 24-7 understands that more DA councillors are set to leave the party to join McKenzie’s PA. A few days ago, influential Eldorado Park Ward 17 councillor Peter Rafferty joined the PA after resigning from the DA. The well-loved councillor proved himself as a tireless worker and activist for service delivery and change in his community. Although he served the DA with distinction, he came to realise that the PA needed to be his new political home. “This party is committed to being the positive force for good and change that my family and I have been looking for, for a long time.” Rafferty said: “Never before have I heard a political party understand and express the plight of not just the people of Eldorado Park, but all communities striving for a better life in South Africa.
