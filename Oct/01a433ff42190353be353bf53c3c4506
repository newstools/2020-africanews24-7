By: Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- Well-known Eldorado Park councillor Peter Rafferty resigned with immediate effect from the Democratic Alliance on Monday morning in a letter to the DA’s City of Johannesburg’s leadership. The departure of the 42-year-old will now prompt a by-election in Ward 17, where Rafferty has served as the ward councillor for several years. The DA has suffered a number of internal leadership and political crises over the past year since the controversial return of Helen Zille as the party’s Federal Council chairperson. Among the high-profile resignations that followed in protest at her return to power was that of former DA mayor Herman Mashaba and former DA leader Mmusi Maimane. Rafferty said: “I feel that I need to move forward and render my services where I do believe I would be a greater asset, not only to my community but also to my family. “I unfortunately can no longer serve under the DA banner. I wish the party and all esteemed members of my current caucus all the best going forward.” Called for comment, Rafferty was mum about which party he would be joining next, though those close to him said it seemed clear that he would be headed for Mashaba’s new party Action SA, which former Gauteng DA leader John Moodey joined earlier this month as its provincial chairperson.
