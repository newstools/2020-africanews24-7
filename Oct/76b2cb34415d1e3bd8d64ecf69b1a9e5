By: Sello Theletsane Head of the City of Johannesburg’s anti-corruption unit, General Shadrack Sibiya has accused his detractors of using the media to destroy him. Sibiya was responding to media reports that he contributed towards the R20 000 bail amount set for deputy national police commissioner, Lieutenant General Bonang Mgwenya. Mgwenya, who is currently the deputy national commissioner for Human Resources management, appeared in the Palm Ridge Magistrates on corruption, fraud and money laundering charges for her alleged role in ensuring a lucrative contract to install warning lights on more than 1 500 police vehicles to a predetermined service provider in 2017. Sibiya, who was present in court did not deny having partly covered the money needed for Mgwenya’s bail. He told Africa News 24-7 that he has a 19-year-old son with Mgwenya. “We lived together for 14 years until 2009. We both moved on with our lives. She lives with our son, and there was no way I was going to ignore when the child sent me a message that her mom was being arrested.” Sibiya said their son was going to be left alone in the house as a result of his mother’s arrest. “What I did is what any responsible and a caring father would have done. Now I can see that someone is using the media to try and drag me into this thing. I am not involved in her career going forward and I do not know what she is busy with and, no matter how ugly it might have been, I am compelled to support my son.” Sibiya said his son is currently writing exams at Wits University “and it was important to try and not destabilize him”. If the mom is arrested, and there is only the two of them in the house, what then should happen to the Child,” asked Sibiya.
