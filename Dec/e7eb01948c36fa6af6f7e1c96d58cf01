By: Staff Reporter The Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu, has called on all South Africans to assist the people of Masiphumelele informal settlement in the City of Cape Town who have been left homeless as a result of fire that destroyed 1000 homes. “What has happened to the people of Masiphumelele is heart-breaking. They were all, like all South Africans, looking forward to spending holidays with their families but all that has been shattered. This catastrophic situation calls on all of us a nation to join hands and assist with whatever we can”, said Minister Sisulu. The Minister has also committed that the National Department will provide all the necessary support to the Western Cape Provincial Government in its effort to ensure that the homeless are provided with shelter and necessary resources to rebuild their structures. She has directed the Director-General, Mr Mbulelo Tshangana and other senior officials of the department to work with Metro and the Province. The Minister has also directed all Water Boards and Human Settlements entities to come on board and assist with items such as clothes, blankets and food. The donations can be dropped off at the Department of Human Settlements in Pretoria and Cape Town. “We are a nation that cares, we have done this before and we can do it again”, added Sisulu.
