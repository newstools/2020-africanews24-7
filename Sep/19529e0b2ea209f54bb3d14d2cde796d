By: Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- The Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Lindiwe Sisulu has called on Chairpersons of all the Water Boards across the country to commit themselves to clean governance; free of any corrupt activity. The Minister was addressing the Chairpersons of Water Boards at a meeting she convened to convey some of her priorities over the next few months and chief to these being ensuring that the sector will not be associated with any corruption. “Let us commit ourselves to clean up the environment in the water sector. We can’t have the same cloud hanging over us. We need to lead in ensuring that ours is a clean environment. We will not tolerate any corrupt activity during our time. It is the only right thing to do”, said Minister Sisulu. “We need an agreement with yourselves. We will sign a declaration with you that binds and commits us all as the leadership of water institutions to ensuring there is no corrupt activity in our area. You represent me on your various boards and while you are Chairpersons of these boards, this environment will be cleaned up and be free of corruption”, added Minister Sisulu. The Minister also implored the Boards to use every cent they have to ensure that the local government, i.e. Water Service Authorities, are provided with bulk water necessary for them to distribute to the people of South Africa, saying corruption has robbed people of their dignity”. The Chairpersons unanimously supported the Minister’s call for clean governance and highlighted some of the challenges which they have discovered and are experiencing in their respective water boards. The Chairpersons also appealed for Minister’s intervention in ensuring that municipalities pay for services. It has been alleged that some municipalities are deliberately not paying for services. This in turn is threatening the operational viability of the Boards. The municipalities currently owe Water Boards an accumulated amount of over R10 billion.
