By: Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- Businessman and an ANC activist Molemela Setona who was recently caught on video insulting a woman Johannesburg Metro Department officer who arrested him, has apologised to the officer, women of South Africa and the ANC. Setona, who is popularly known as Magesta, was caught on video wearing ANC regalia insulting a woman metro officer. Setona was heavily criticised on social media after the video, which was taken last month went viral. He told Africa News 24-7 that he regretted his actions. “I lost my cool after the officer accused me in the video, she was unlawfully filming that I had stolen food parcels meant for the poor. This lie broke my heart as the same food parcels the officer was accusing me of stealing, were bought by me for poor families struggling during this difficult lockdown.” “What compounded the situation was when the same officer, violated my constitutionally enshrined right to be presumed innocent until proven otherwise. However, no amount of anger justifies my actions. As a former law-enforcement officer myself, I should have known better. Many comrades know me, I respect women. What transpired on the night of my arrest is totally uncharacteristic of me.” “I want to take this opportunity to apologise unreservedly to the officer, my glorious movement the ANC and all women of South Africa.” Setona disclosed that the case against him was withdrawn by the court on Wednesday (6 May) due to lack of evidence.
