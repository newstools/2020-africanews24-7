CAPE TOWN, August 1- Parliament’s tourism portfolio committee has expressed sadness at the death of one its members, ANC MP Zamuxolo Joseph Peter, after a short illness due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) on Friday. “Mr Peter, who was driven by the objectives of non-racialism, non-sexism, and a united South Africa, joined Parliament as a member of the National Assembly after the 2019 general elections. He served on the committee with dedication since his deployment to the committee after the establishment of the sixth Parliament,” committee chairman Supra Mahumapelo said in a statement. “One could always count on Zamuxolo Peter for assistance when the assistance is required, and he would go the extra mile to ensure that the objectives of the committee were met. I remember when a particular radio station was looking for a Nguni speaking person for a radio show on tourism in traditional areas, Mr Peter, being committed to the transformation of tourism in villages, townships and small towns, stepped in and did a fine job of promoting the work of the committee,” he said. “One of his ideals was to ensure that we have corruption-free governance in South Africa, and that we, as Members of Parliament, exercise our oversight mandate and hold the government accountable for its delivery of services to the people. The committee sends its heartfelt condolences to Mr Peter’s family, friends, and his comrades. May his soul rest in eternal peace,” Mahumapelo said. Peter was also a member of the standing committee on the auditor general. – African News Agency (ANA)
