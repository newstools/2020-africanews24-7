By: Jessie Duarte The Mayor of Welkom speaks to the SANDF, the arm of the state charged with defending the constitution of the Republic of South Africa and refers to the people of Bronville as Boesmanne and drunkards. He tells the army to use their force to deal with the people. This mayor is an ANC member and he is the first citizen of a city rich in diversity. His expressions of racism can never belong to the ANC whom he represents. We distance ourselves from him as an individual as from his remarks which offends the constitution of the country and the values of the ANC. We will wait for the PEC of the Free State to act. But such action must be in Defence of the dignity of the people of Bronville. Jessie Duarte is the Deputy Secretary General of the ANC
