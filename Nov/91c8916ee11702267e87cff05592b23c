By: Staff Reporter Following shocking revelations by City of Johannesburg mayor Geoff Makhubo at the Zondo Commision on Friday, the Patriotic Alliance (PA) has announced its intention to lodge a motion of no confidence against Makhubo in the next council meeting. This follows proceedings at the Zondo Commission on Friday where it was revealed that Makhubo’s company, Molelwane Consulting, had been in business with the council since 2005 through to 2011. Makhubo claimed he had resigned his directorship of the company in November 2011 after he had entered public office in May 2011. However, the contract between the city and Makhubo’s Molelwane Consulting was extended from 2011 to 2015 despite him then occupying the city’s Finance MMC position, a position in which his responsibilities included playing an oversight role in numerous contracts, including Regiments Capital, which had a partnership with Molelwane Consulting. PA national executive committee (NEC) member Kenny Kunene said the motion was the only tool available to get rid of Makhubo “who is clearly not fit to hold any public office”. “More worrying is the fact that Makhubo does not see or admit his corruption and conflict of interest. The City of Joburg cannot be led by a fatally compromised figure like Makhubo.” Kunene called on “all Joburg councillors who have the interests of Joburg residents at heart to join the PA in its effort to get rid of Makhubo”. Meanwhile Africa News 24-7 has reliably been informed that the ANC top leadership is meeting to decide Makhubu’s fate. A highly-placed source said it was highly likely that the ANC would suspend its embattled mayor. Africa News 24-7 has also been informed that the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) is set to seize properties of 18 individuals, among them Makhubo and his business associates.
