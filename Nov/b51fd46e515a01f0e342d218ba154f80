By: Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- More influential community leaders are leaving the DA to join the Patriotic Alliance (PA) led by Gayton McKenzie. A few weeks ago, the PA welcomed in its ranks influential and much loved DA Eldorado Park councillor Peter Rafferty. The latest influential community leaders to dump the DA to join the PA are Pastor Isaac Peterson and DA chairman of Ward 29 and chairman for Soweto East constituency Ismael Steenkamp. “It is with great pleasure I welcome Pastor Isaac Peterson to the PA family, said McKenzie. He added that he was also deeply humbled to welcome Steenkamp. “I have always admired your tenacity and let’s do it spirit and little did I know that God will make our paths to cross.”
