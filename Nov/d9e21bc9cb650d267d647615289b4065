By: Staff Reporter There could soon be a new coalition government in Nelson Mandela Bay as early as next week, this is according to a report in the Herald LIVE . Economic development, tourism and agriculture portfolio committee political boss, Marlon Daniels announced at a news conference at the PA’s Gelvandale office in Port Elizabeth that plans were afoot to change governance in the Bay — again… The five parties have a combined 61 seats in the council, meaning should they agree on who should occupy which position, they would have the majority to form a new government. Daniels said he had been meeting with DA Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga, whom he said had an “appetite to take over City Hall”. He, however, warned that they would do what “we are known for and flip-flop”. “We are going to usher in a new government next week,” he said, adding that 61 councillors have signed a petition calling for an election of a mayor, speaker and council chief whip.
