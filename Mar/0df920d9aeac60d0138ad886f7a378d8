In the early hours of Monday morning, Sudan’s Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok was in an attempted assassination attempt narrowly escaping the explosion, which damaged two security cars and a third vehicle in the capital of Khartoum, Sudan. No civilians were harmed in the attack which happened near the northern Kober bridge, while the political envoy was on route to Hamdok’s office. The cause of the blast has been unconfirmed, as the forensic team continue to comb the scene. Hamdock, undaunted by the attack, stated on Twitter, “I would like to assure the people of Sudan that I am safe and in good shape. Rest assured that what happened today will not stand in the way of our transition, instead it is an additional push to the wheel of change in Sudan.” The Prime Minister, a former United Nations economist, was elected in September 2019 and has had strong support from the Sudanese public, after Omar-Al-Bashir was victoriously removed from power by a military coup, at the aid and support of many pro-democracy civilians. The Sudanese Opposition Alliance, which operates with the Forces for Freedom and Change issued a public statement, saying, “we wish Dr Abdalla Hamdok success in one of the hardest periods in the history of our country and people, a period that the revolutionary Sudanese people are looking forward to and observing with hopefulness.” At present, Mr Hamdock, who is in good standing with the African Union, hopes to have Sudan removed from the U.S list of terrorism threats, and has offered to co-operate with the International Criminal Court in the investigation into the alleged war crimes in the Darfur conflict, which happened only just a decade ago in Sudan. He stated, “we paid a hefty price for this revolution for a better tomorrow and for sustainable peace. Our revolution should always be guarded by its peacefulness.” – African News Agency (ANA)
