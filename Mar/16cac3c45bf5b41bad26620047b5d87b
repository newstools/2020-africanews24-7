By: Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- Newzroom Afrika TV news channel has suspended the popular late night show Your View and its host Onkgopotse JJ Tabane for making “disparaging” comments about the people of Limpopo. “They were offensive and disrespectful and he has acknowledged this and apologised on his personal Twitter account.” The channel added that Tabane would also be making an apology on News@Prime on Friday night. Newzroom Afrika said that despite Tabane’s apology, the matter is under review by its editorial sub-committee led by veteran journalist Dr Joe Thloloe. “Pending the outcome of the investigation, Your View will be suspended until further notice,” it added.
