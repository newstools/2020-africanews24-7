CAPE TOWN, March 5 – Gauteng premier David Makhura announced on Thursday that the council in Tshwane had been dissolved and the municipality, home to South Africa’s capital Pretoria, placed under administration until a new council is elected in 90 days. The Gauteng government resorted to the move after political wrangling in Tshwane left the municipality without a mayor, mayoral committee or city manager, leading to the collapse of service delivery. Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen, whose party has run the municipality since 2016 in an alliance with other parties after unseating the African National Congress, said on Wednesday he believed the council had been deliberately destabilised in order to drive it into administration and allow a political takeover. The DA’s mayor was ousted by a motion of no confidence in January. – African News Agency (ANA)
