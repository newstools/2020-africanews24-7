KIMBERLEY, January 11 – Northern Cape African National Congress chairman Zamani Saul on Saturday called on members and leaders of the governing party to engage in a “self-revolution” in 2020. “The next few months in 2020 must mark self-revolution in the ANC; all members must do serious introspection and ask themselves whether their conduct contributes to enhancing the integrity of the movement,” Saul told ANC supporters gathered at the Tafel Lager Park Stadium in Kimberley in the Northern Cape for the ANC’s 108th annual January 8 anniversary celebrations. Saul said 2020 should mark “fundamental change” within the organisation to breach the trust deficit between the party and its followers and to “wipe out arrogance”. “We must do everything to remain among our people, know what maters in their lives and know their concerns. This generation of leaders must push with zeal for radical economic transformation. To succeed in the battle against corruption, we must wage war at the risk of personal loss,” he said. ANC national executive committee (NEC) members have been in the drought-ravaged province since Monday as part of the build-up to the celebrations, where president Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver his January 8 statement later in the day. The Northern Cape was officially declared a drought state of emergency this week. “The ANC has brought rain to some areas of the province. But in some areas it is still struggling drought,” said Saul. He urged the province’s ANC leaders to “build on the momentum” of the 108 celebrations. VIPs attending the event included Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed, recipient of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, and representatives from 33 embassies. – African News Agency (ANA)
