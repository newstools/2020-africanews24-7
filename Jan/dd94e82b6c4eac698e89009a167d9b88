By: Clyde Ramalaine Apartheid atrocities in re-opening of cases attest shades of privilege and white celebration departure points. There is an interesting narrative emerging about apartheid crimes as evidencing in the Timol and also now Neil Aggett reopened cases. I thought I was off on a tangent in my thinking when Solly Mapaila of the South Africa Communist Party (SACP) confirmed my thinking as wholly sane. Mapaila speaking on the fringes of the currently re-opened and unfolding Neil Aggett case lamented how many white South Africans who sacrificed their lives in the fight against apartheid were not given enough recognition in the country. Mapaila’s attendance coincided with the testimony of ANC veteran and former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan, who also testified how she was detained and tortured at the same police station. Aggett was found hanging in his cell at the John Vorster Square police station (now JHB Central police station) and an inquest into his death found no foul play. As with many things in SA, my musing and observations and questions will be misunderstood as proverbially spitting on the contributions of what apartheid defined as white comrades. Going for this easy and lazy option, however, will not deter me to use my right privilege to a public opinion for which I fought in the liberation of myself under apartheid. I am of the view that every crime of apartheid warrants due to investigation. Justice for the masses remains a mirage and the imagination of the wishful thinking because justice appears wrapped in economic privilege.
While these must be revealed for its gross injustices with the necessary aim of finally unearthing the truth, there appears a reinforcing of an emerging narrative that again the black-led liberation struggle evidences those apartheid did not define in African and black descriptions for identity markers as the actual heroes of a South Africa liberation cause. This distinction therefore, warrants again special appreciation and recognition for this group of people. I will say it again; apartheid could do many things to those it declared as whites who also self- identified with an overarching black struggle it just never could deny those it classified as white their white identity. We warrant engaging what that means as I have asked in another musing. A farcical and hijacked TRC process Topics of justice and amnesty reverberate in the front and back of the Webster, Timol and Aggett cases. This again brings us to the issue of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). We know that the TRC had two frames, a public one and a not so public one. The public one was Desmond Tutu. We know the TRC, while celebrated by some as fulcrum moment remains the biggest farce served on a South Africa citizenry. I have on several instances opined, was the biggest farce ever served on a south African citizenry, simply because a religious leader Desmond Tutu inserted his ultra-ego into due justice and was allowed to hijack this significant very important moment in history until the truth was sacrificed at the altar of reconciliation. Justice was never attained for SA rushed to be one, to play rugby in green and gold, to be called a Rainbow nation when the society never engaged or endorsed what rainbow means. Despite our love for admiration of Tutu, we warrant proving honest on his role in shaping the outcomes of that process. I have elsewhere argued, if former President Thabo Mbeki almost singularly in Kantian sense eternalised the uncritical apartheid borrowed SA race-based identity formulations for a post-apartheid common citizenry, then Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu gave us the uncritical frames and linguistic handle of what reconciliation, forgiveness and to some degree truth means. Our sin was that we failed much earlier to publicly engage these leaderships on the said subjects. A part reason for that was the blind admiration a generation I make part of had for these that we failed to critically engage what we admired. We know Tutu badgered people like Winnie Mandela into apologising for what she never believed was necessary. Tutu also became very annoyed with some whom he called to accept the offers of forgiveness when they rejected apartheid’s dirty hands. We also know that the ANC was forced by the National Party into a TRC process since there was a threat.
The often not so easily conceded or know fact is that in early 1994 while the gathering of seeming opposite sides of political elite met in negotiations and underway in the Good Hope Centre, Cape Town, ANC members of the delegation were told as later borne out by Mac Maharaj of security reports that among others General Jannie Geldenhyus and the then SADF stood ready to deliver a coup if the subject of amnesty was not agreed to upfront. FW De Klerk later would also confirm this simmering threat of Geldenhuys and the SADF in demand of amnesty as a condition for elections.
This matter of amnesty, therefore, was made a condition for the upcoming elections. In this sense, the ANC was bulldozed and forced into the scripted TRC process. While the masses were misled to assume that truth was the objective of uncovering a forced amnesty [led by threats of an impending coup] and religious personal draping of reconciliation were the actual driving forces hence South Africa still awaits the truth and due justice. We know that the TRC adopted may shades for diverse agendas from personal to political if not economic reasons. We hear again as was the case with the TRC how apartheid defined whites were incarcerated tortured and abused. This emerging narrative presents at least a few points of observation worthy for discussion as emerging framed narratives.
· It appears there is an agreed lack of interest to engage the deaths of many apartheid defined African and black victims.
· Is it possible that cases of this nature while seeking justice equally adopt shades of political campaigns that again confirm factions? We saw this when Neil Aggett’s sister as was her right reflected on the contribution of Neil while including Aggett did not die for state capture as introduced by a Zuma presidency. It is here that the lines get blurred since we then must ask is a legitimate case for Neil Aggett’s murder inquest not again abused for factional politics and should we assume those who will testify at the inquest will all be the natural angels while the natural demons who were Aggett’s comrades and shared torture with him are disqualified by a factional agenda that hijacks the cause of justice necessary to be attained for Neil Aggett and many others. · Permit me to make another observation. It appears that cases such as that of [Timol and Aggett] of this nature again are made possible if nor defined by the nagging reality of and undying economic privileged disposition of economics which affords these cases to be pursued. I guess I am saying can we accept that the cases of Ernest Dipale whom no dissimilar to Timol and Aggett died at the John Vorster cells in orchestrated claims of suicide, is not forthcoming or can’t be made because the means [capital] does not exist for his family. We stand confronted to ask again is justice the benefit of the privileged, does it ultimately translate to pure economics or the privilege of a particular class? Were Timol and Aggett cases entertained because they had the economic means to bring a case for justice?
· Let us then categorically ask with no form of apprehension or embarrassment will the cases of the many others not so privileged in economic disposition ever serve for justice to be tested?
· While we engage the subject of reopening of cases as an unfolding reality, can the arms of justice educate and help the masses to appreciate how some cases as in that of Timol and Aggett ultimately come to serve for justice cause when the bulk of cases that concerns those apartheid classified as Africans and Coloureds simply do not make it on to the roll?
· At another level when we have to listen to Barbara Hogan among others relating their accounts of personal incarceration and torture, are we duped into again having to express our indebtedness to the apartheid classified white heroes of a struggle who always continue to outshine the apartheid defined in racist exacted African classification. We know it because Solly Mapaila in the uniqueness of apartheid white identity holders today made the case that whites who enjoined themselves with the struggle are not sufficiently recognised.
· Shall we ask again, will the death of Ernest Dipale and many others who equally were murdered by apartheid at its John Vorster gallows ever have their Timol and Aggett moments of reopened cases? What happened to Dipale who was also found hanging in the cell and it was also just reduced to commit suicide. Lastly is the reopening of cases of this nature the function and responsibility of families or should this not be a basic assumption of a democratic state to ensure past injustices is dealt with given the fact of the failures of the TRC.
